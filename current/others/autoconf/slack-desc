# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

autoconf: autoconf (generate configuration scripts)
autoconf:
autoconf: GNU autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
autoconf: scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
autoconf: These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
autoconf: systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf creates a
autoconf: configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
autoconf: operating system features that the package can use, in the form of m4
autoconf: macro calls. You must install the "m4" package to be able to use
autoconf: autoconf.
