# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tftp-hpa:
tftp-hpa: The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is normally used only for
tftp-hpa: booting diskless workstations (or the Slackware installer). The tftp
tftp-hpa: package provides the user interface for TFTP, which allows users to
tftp-hpa: transfer files to and from a remote machine. This program and TFTP
tftp-hpa: provide very little security, and should not be enabled unless it is
tftp-hpa: expressly needed.
