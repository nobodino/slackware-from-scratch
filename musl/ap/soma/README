Soma - a dialog internet radio player

with or without the -playlist option should work.  Extra stations can
be added in ~/.soma/stations.conf.

Config Files:

User:                        Global:

Stations should be added to the user list like this:

Name,URL

You cannot use a comma , in the name or the URL.

User stations are listed before global in all stations list.  Custom
genre and theme files can be made and will be listed along with the
default set.

I would be glad of any extra radio urls emailed to me so I can add to
the default list.

NOTES:

The Jack and NAS options for output device will only work if MPlayer is
built against them.

When changing/selecting soundcard output device you must press space on
the option.  Just scrolling down and hitting Enter does nothing.

BUGS:

Soma may induce the side effects of general well-being and profound
spiritual satisfaction.

REAL BUGS:

Some people might find screen messes up the dialog colours.  If you have
this line in ~/.screenrc:

attrcolor b ".I"

You might want to comment it out and try again as it seems to turn off
the bold attribute.  See the screen man page for more info.
