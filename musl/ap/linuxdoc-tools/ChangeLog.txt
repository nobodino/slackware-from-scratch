  * gnome-doc-tools: Make '/usr/bin/xml2po' and its accompanying Python module
    build against Python3.
    Thanks to bassmadrigal and ponce on LQ for the report and the patch.
  * docbook2x: Removed '--disable-maintainer-mode' configuration flag
    because it's no longer valid.

    (slacktrack v2.19 handles this by default)
    Remove code to delete 'perllocal.pod' (created by SGMLSPL)
    (slacktrack -Q handles this).

 Stuart Winter <mozes@slackware.com>

 linuxdoc-tools 0.9.72, build 3.
 Stuart Winter <mozes@slackware.com>
  * Remove .la files from the package at the suggestion of volkerdi.
    /usr/lib/libospgrove.la
    /usr/lib/libosp.la
    /usr/lib/libostyle.la
    /usr/lib/libogrove.la
    (or "lib64").
  None of these are referenced by a '.la' file within any Slackware package.
  For rationale behind this, see:

 linuxdoc-tools 0.9.72, build 2.
 Stuart Winter <mozes@slackware.com>
  * Switched to OpenJade-1.3.2 (from 1.3.3-pre1 which was segfaulting)
    No other distributions that I checked ever upgraded beyond this last
    stable release.  Debian are using a modified version of the 1.4 branch
    but this doesn't work with our stack yet.
  * Upgraded to perl-XML-NamespaceSupport-1.12
  * Upgraded to perl-XML-SAX-Base-1.09
  * Updated build script to work with bash 4.4.  Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger.
  * Support '.conf.new' for config files within /etc/asciidoc
    Thanks to franzen on LQ for the suggestion.
  * Log the output of the postbuildfixes.sh script (package fixups, post build,
    pre-packaging) to the slacktrack log file.  The asciidoc .conf.new support
    is conducted within that script, and includes a check as to whether any
    dangling symlinks appeared as a result of mv'ing the files.
    Requries slacktrack v2.18 as it uses a new option to achieve this.

  * Upgraded to DocBook XSL Stylesheets 1.79.1
    No longer ship the "tools" directory because it grew from a couple of
    MBs to 23MB, and the content of it looks to be just package updating tools which
    does not make sense for a vendor to include in a binary package OS.
  * Apply patch from Fedora for AsciiDoc to write manifests in
    UTF8 by default.

    now creates symlinks to 'linuxdoc'.

 Fixes:

    documentation for git.

 Stuart Winter <mozes@slackware.com>
 linuxdoc-tools 0.9.66, build 4
 Upgraded a couple of component packages:

  * asciidoc-8.6.2.
 Fixes:
  * gtk-doc: Patched to fix a problem with vim.
    Thanks to Trev Carey-Smith for the report and Robby Workman for
    finding the patch.

 linuxdoc-tools 0.9.66, build 3
 Upgraded a few component packages:
  * Upgraded to gtk-doc-1.15
  * Upgraded to asciidoc-8.5.3
  * Upgraded to gnome-doc-tools-0.20.1
    Thanks to Steve Kennedy for the notification about the new version.
  * Updated various packages to include more recent patches from Fedora.
  * Changed build script to use rpm2cpio instead of rpm2tgz because
    with different builds/versions of rpm2tgz (or "rpm" - I'm not sure
    what causes the change) the "tgz" that is created flips back and
    forth between having the content in a sub directory, or the root
    of the archive.
    Using rpm2cpio means that as a minimum you need seamonkey-solibs
    installed because rpm2cpio requires libnss3.so.  Mozilla-FireFox
    & Thunderbird also contain this library.  Slackware is built on a
    full system, so this shouldn't pose a problem.

 Stuart Winter <mozes@slackware.com>
 linuxdoc-tools 0.9.66, build 2.
 * Applied an upstream patch to gtk-doc-1.13, fixing problems
   with gtkdoc-fixxref.
 * Updated build script to work with the new rpm2tgz which now
   packages all src RPM contents into the root of the tar archive
   rather than a sub directory.

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.56, build 5.
 * Replace /usr/share/xml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.5/ent/isogrk4.ent with
   the Unicode-4 entity map from sgml-common, to fix errors such as
   ""1D6C2" is not a character number in the document character set"
   Thanks to Niels Horn for the fix and Ron Parker for the report.

   docbook-xsl-doc-1.75.1
   gnome-doc-utils-0.17.2
   asciidoc-8.4.5
   OpenJade-1.3.3-pre1

This package has a problem producing simple docbook documents
though, as reported by Ron Parker.

 For example:
  # cat << EOF > /tmp/test.txt
Hello
this will not work yet
EOF
  # asciidoc -b docbook  /tmp/test.txt
  # db2rtf /tmp/test.xml
You'll see this error:
jade:/usr/share/xml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.5/ent/isogrk4.ent:42:30:E: "1D6C2" is not a character number in the document character set

I've been reading a few URLs:
http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/200511/msg00119.html
http://bugs.gentoo.org/238785

The majority of the build process for Docbook and supporting tools
is taken verbatim from Linux From Scratch:
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/index.html
I have in the past looked at Fedora and Debian spec & rules files
but LFS has great documentation and makes maintaining this package
a lot easier, so I'm very keen to keep to their build process
(including file/directory paths) as much as possible.

If anybody knows how to resolve this, please let me know!

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.56, build 3.
 * Remove orphaned *.pyc (Python compiled) files.
   The addition of GNOME doc-tools causes some Python *.py
   files to be recompiled, resulting in them appearing in this
   package. These files belonged to the Python package and
   therefore caused an overlap.

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.21, build 4
  * Converted from docbook RPM source builds to direct source build, with
    the build script code by: Jerome Pinot
    based on the Linux From Scratch documentation.
    Merged some of Jerome's code back into the original linuxdoc-tools.build
    script.
    This fixes many bugs with the previous package, with broken catalogs
    and so on.
  * Upgraded to gtk-doc v1.8
  * Upgraded to DocBook SGML DTD v4.5
  * Upgraded to DocBook DSSSL Stylesheets v1.79
  * Upgraded to DocBook XML DTD v4.5
  * Upgraded to DocBook XSL Stylesheets v1.72.0 & docs
  * Added AsciiDoc v8.2.1
  * Added xmlto v0.0.18
  * Removed unused build script code cruft from linuxdoc-tools.build
  * Re-ordered the build script since OpenSP v1.5.2 requires xmlto,
    and xmlto requires the docbook stuff to be installed.
  * Removed buildDocBookCatalog script.  If you delete your system's SGML or XML
    catalog scripts, thinking that this script can repopulate them, it won't.
    If you're adding docbook data to your system, you need to read the docs that
    come with the new data you're installing.
  * Thanks to Red Hat for the loan of a laptop on which to test this build ;-)
