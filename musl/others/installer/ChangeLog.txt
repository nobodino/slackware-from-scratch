Sun Jan 17 20:08:17 UTC 2021
  Upgrade to busybox-1.32.1.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jan  9 19:43:33 UTC 2021
  Add libzstd.so.1, needed by kmod.
+--------------------------+
Thu Dec 31 20:35:53 UTC 2020
  Add libelogind.so.0, needed by libprocps.so.8.
+--------------------------+
Thu Dec 17 20:19:08 UTC 2020
  Add libinih, needed by xfsprogs.
+--------------------------+
Tue Dec 15 19:24:23 UTC 2020
  Update dropbear to get ecdsa support. Thanks to Robby Workman.
+--------------------------+
Tue Dec  8 19:22:18 UTC 2020
  SeTPKG: Change KDE blurb to say "The KDE Plasma Desktop"
+--------------------------+
Fri Oct 30 22:06:27 UTC 2020
  Add libnsl. Thanks to Olek.
+--------------------------+
Thu Oct 29 21:50:02 UTC 2020
  Don't build the inetd busybox applet.
+--------------------------+
Thu Aug 20 05:22:35 UTC 2020
  Include /usr/bin/env.
+--------------------------+
Sun Jul 26 18:30:17 UTC 2020
  Add neofetch. Seems like a useful system information tool to have in the
  installer, and it's small enough.
  Note that without /etc/os-release, this gives a generic Tux logo instead of
  the Slackware logo, but that also keeps the system information from getting
  clipped if the terminal is 80 columns.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jul 10 00:21:42 UTC 2020
  Add speakup modules to the installer image. We'll hopefully figure out how to
  better handle these in the future.
+--------------------------+
Sun Jun  7 23:24:18 UTC 2020
  Fix NTFS partition detection, and add support for exFAT.
+--------------------------+
Sun May 17 19:57:48 UTC 2020
  Added PAM libraries, security modules, and config files.
+--------------------------+
Tue Mar 31 18:02:13 UTC 2020
  In series selection menu, don't (falsely) mention Qt being in the KDE series.
+--------------------------+
Sat Feb 29 06:17:27 UTC 2020
  Added kernel modules:
  dm-bufio, dm-bio-prison, dm-persistent-data, dm-snapshot, dm-thin-pool.
  Don't include dm-snapshot in module-blacklist.
  These changes prompted by the suggestion to include dm-thin-pool.ko in the
  installer by jr_bob_dobbs.
+--------------------------+
Sat Feb  1 22:31:14 UTC 2020
  Compress kernel modules in parallel.
  Install packages with --terse mode.
  Touch /etc/shells to prevent harmless but ugly build-time error.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jan 31 20:25:54 UTC 2020
  Added zerofree and sparsify binaries and zerofree manpage.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jan 27 00:09:05 UTC 2020
  Added libkeyutils.so.1, needed by the krb5 libraries.
  Thanks to dodoLQ.
  Added nano editor. See build script for additional options ;-)
  Thanks to Didier Spaier.
  Fix ldd shebang.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jan 24 00:35:26 UTC 2020
  Added libraries: libgssapi_krb5, libk5crypto, libkrb5, libkrb5support.
+--------------------------+
Sun Jan 12 20:36:57 UTC 2020
  /sbin/reboot: Attempt to kill running processes and sync/umount/sync
  filesystems before rebooting. Thanks to Jeebizz.
+--------------------------+
Mon Dec 30 20:05:46 UTC 2019
  SeTEFI: Patched to remove extra whitespace from lsblk output.
  Thanks to Didier Spaier.
+--------------------------+
Sat Dec  7 02:24:58 UTC 2019
  sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:
  /sbin/probe: adjust to newer "cryptsetup status" output. This fixes all LVM
  volumes being listed twice.
+--------------------------+
Fri Dec  6 20:16:45 UTC 2019
  repack_installer.SlackBuild:  Added.
    This repacks the installer from the tree found under
    $TMP/build-slackware-installer, allowing changes to be made and tested.
  build_installer.sh:  Trivial typo fix - add a space in a comment.
+--------------------------+
Sat Nov 30 21:01:01 UTC 2019
  Use $NUMJOBS with busybox make install.
+--------------------------+
Wed Aug 21 18:57:50 UTC 2019
  Properly install libcryptsetup since it has moved under /usr.
  Thanks to formalist for the bug report.
+--------------------------+
Mon Aug  5 07:05:18 UTC 2019
  Don't use -s (--stupid) when installing syslinux. This loads much faster and
  _probably_ won't increase the probability of boot failure. But, if it fails
  let me know.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jul 29 21:51:59 UTC 2019
  Include libraries from the argon2 and json-c packages, needed by cryptsetup.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jul 12 18:42:02 UTC 2019
  build-installer.sh: Add cqhci.ko kernel module.
  Thanks to Pomme Raccoon.
+--------------------------+
Wed Jul 10 22:33:27 UTC 2019
  /sbin/reboot: shell script to call the real reboot with "reboot -f" to
  prevent a reboot hang after installation.
+--------------------------+
Sat Apr 27 19:53:20 UTC 2019
  build_installer.sh: remove final dangling symlink check. This gets into
  a filesystem loop that takes a bit of time, and has never turned up any
  dangling symlinks that actually need attention.
+--------------------------+
Sun Mar  3 19:17:45 UTC 2019
  Update busybox to 1.30.1.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jan 26 19:58:30 UTC 2019
  Fixed detecting FAT/NTFS partitions on UEFI systems.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jan 25 23:06:42 UTC 2019
  Updated the elilo bootloaders in /EFI/BOOT which were older versions
  (possibly with the 8MB kernel size limit?)
+--------------------------+
Thu Jan 24 20:01:25 UTC 2019
  SeTEFI: If the kernel doesn't detect efi, bail.
  SeTEFI: Detect EFI partition using lsblk. Thanks to Didier Spaier.
+--------------------------+
Tue Jan 22 22:42:47 UTC 2019
  Before running the CONFIGURE section, create bind mounts to /dev, /proc, and
  /sys. This is useful for chrooting and setting up boot loaders.
  Also add "mkbindmounts" command to do this manually for anything that's
  mounted on /mnt. This avoids having to type these commands when using the
  installer for system rescue purposes.
+--------------------------+
Sun Jan  6 19:54:10 UTC 2019
  Account for .x64 suffix on /boot/config-* files with x86_64 when installing
  the config files and /boot/config symlink. Thanks to Edward Grattan.
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 28 05:31:04 UTC 2018
  Activate LVM volumes at boot, not only when setup is run.
  Make /etc/mtab a symlink to /proc/mounts on the installer.
  On a freshly installed system, make /etc/mtab a symlink to /proc/mounts.
  Include f2fs-tools on the installer.
  Support installing on F2FS partitions.
+--------------------------+
Wed Oct 10 22:41:29 UTC 2018
  Added Hyper-V keyboard and framebuffer modules.
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep 13 19:42:20 UTC 2018
  Load ter-114v.psf.gz in rc.font.
+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 10 20:41:59 UTC 2018
  Switch to ter-114v.psf.gz as the consolefont. It has been reported that the
  font we were using (ter-v14v.psf.gz) restricts the available console colors
  from 16 to 8 due to needing an extra bit for the higher number of available
  glyphs (though in testing here I couldn't see any difference). The new font
  covers ISO8859-1, ISO8859-15, and Windows-1252 codepages. I'm still not sure
  it's the best choice, so additional input is welcomed.
+--------------------------+
Wed Jul 25 03:29:26 UTC 2018
  Use ter-v14v.psf.gz as the consolefont. It supports more character sets, and
  the larger font was causing wraparound on UEFI (at least on bare metal here).
+--------------------------+
Fri Jun 22 23:38:50 UTC 2018
  Added libaio (needed by lvm).
+--------------------------+
Wed Jun 20 21:08:45 UTC 2018
  Upgraded dropbear. Thanks to Robby Workman.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jun 18 17:53:56 UTC 2018
  When compressing the initrd with xz, add: -C crc32 
  Use xzcat instead of zcat in a few places where the build script wants to
  extract a previous initrd.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jun 18 04:13:53 UTC 2018
  Copy libefiboot to the installer (needed by efibootmgr).
  Compress the kernel modules with xz.
  Compress the initrd image with xz.
+--------------------------+
Thu Jun 14 01:16:42 UTC 2018
  Copy libefivar to the installer (needed by efibootmgr).
+--------------------------+
Wed Jun  6 20:31:26 UTC 2018
  Fix finding some DOS/Win partition types. Thanks to Stuart Winter.
  Wipe the probe md5sum to force rescanning partitions if setup is restarted.
+--------------------------+
Sat Apr 28 20:04:23 UTC 2018
  Reduce sleep times in the installer. You'll just have to read faster. ;-)
+--------------------------+
Sat Apr 21 00:29:54 UTC 2018
  Use busybox's dd after all... it wasn't the cause of the size display bug.
  Don't try to migrate /tmp storage to the hard drive. We're not in the
  floppy disk era any more and are unlikely to run out of space on a tmpfs.
+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 18 04:06:45 UTC 2018
  Update busybox to 1.28.3.
  Add dd and mcookie to the installer.
  Add a dialog when setup starts to tell the user that partition information
  is being collected.
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar 31 18:00:31 UTC 2018
  sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:
    /sbin/probe: use md5sum of /proc/partitions to determine if previously
    cached results should be returned.
+--------------------------+
Thu Mar 22 09:51:59 UTC 2018
  Fixes for ARM:
  * Fix module loading from etc/rc.d/rc.S
  * Update architecture quadlet for build target
+--------------------------+
Thu Mar  1 21:56:38 UTC 2018
  Put up "Scanning for USB stick..." dialog during the scan delay.
  Make "terse" the pre-selected menu mode.
+--------------------------+
Thu Mar  1 06:55:30 UTC 2018
  /sbin/probe: Add -c option to use the cached previous results if possible.
  Use cached probe where possible in /usr/lib/setup scripts.
  In many places, remove double spaces from after sentences in accordance with
  the Chicago Manual of Style recommendations.
+--------------------------+
Mon Feb 19 22:30:33 UTC 2018
  Add packages: lzip, lzlib, plzip.
+--------------------------+
Tue Feb 13 06:43:38 UTC 2018
  Put files in the same places that they would be on a real install, instead
  of shoving everything into /bin. Remove busybox symlinks if we have a real
  version to use instead.
  Don't copy /bin/tar-[0-9]* to the installer. /bin/tar is good enough
  (check it with --version ;-), and the pkgtools no longer use tar-1.13.
  Don't sed the ldd shebang, no need now that we have a /usr/bin/bash symlink.
  Make sure that /bin/sh points to bash, but don't mess with other shell links.
  Copy /usr/bin/ddrescue from the package to the installer.
+--------------------------+
Sun Feb  4 04:24:08 UTC 2018
  Create /etc/default directory.
  Include /etc/default/{nfs,rpc}
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 22 18:34:44 UTC 2017
  Update to the newer elilo.x64 binary in sources/efi*
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 22 04:49:08 UTC 2017
  SeTEFI: Don't use fdisk -l (unneccessary). Thanks to Didier Spaier.
  SetEFI: Scan /dev/mmcblk[0-9]. Thanks to zerouno.
  probe: Filter another possible EFI partition label.
+--------------------------+
Sun Nov 12 22:08:51 UTC 2017
  Include iproute2 and hostname packages (to get hostname and ip man pages).
+--------------------------+
Mon Oct  2 17:35:19 UTC 2017
  slackinstall: When doing a network install, don't download a package if the
  tagfile is going to skip installing it. Thanks to ivandi.
+--------------------------+
Sat Sep 30 21:06:10 UTC 2017
  SeTnet attempts to cat $TMP/SeTT_PX at boot time, when it doesn't exist.
  I just directed stderr from these attempts to /dev/null to get rid of the
  error message, but perhaps there's a bug here that needs to be addressed?
  SeTnet doesn't actually seem to use $T_PX for anything other than determining
  if it's running on the installer or an installed system.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jul 28 17:09:07 UTC 2017
  Upgraded to busybox-1.27.1, and enabled damn near everything. Might as well,
  since the size of e.g. kernel modules will dwarf the busybox binary anyway,
  and any real utilities we use will be copied over the symlinks after busybox
  is built.
  Removed /usr/bin/man shell script -- use busybox man applet instead.
  Create /usr/bin/man? -> cat? symlinks to make busybox man happy with the
  preprocessed manpages.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jul 17 18:47:36 UTC 2017
  In busybox-dot-config, add support for findfs and volume ids.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jul  7 18:53:31 UTC 2017
  Dnsmasq has changed to using libidn2, so add the libidn2 library and the
  libunistring library to the installer. Don't add libidn version 1 anymore,
  as nothing else on the installer uses it.
+--------------------------+
Tue May  9 20:22:15 UTC 2017
  Replace hardcoded /mnt with ${T_PX} in many places.
  Thanks to alienBOB.
+--------------------------+
Tue May  9 18:43:55 UTC 2017
  Use nosuid,nodev,noexec mount options for /dev/shm in installer-created
  /etc/fstab.
+--------------------------+
Thu May  4 21:31:35 UTC 2017
  Patched SeTEFI and probe to fix NVMe support.
  Thanks to Didier Spaier.
+--------------------------+
Thu Feb 23 19:00:56 UTC 2017
  sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:
    /sbin/probe, line 156:  filter output through strings to avoid bash warning
    about NUL bytes in input.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jan  2 23:34:36 UTC 2017
  build_installer:  Use the 'bash' package rather than compiling it.
     Removed some old ARM cruft.
     Added some basic 'aarch64' (arm64) support.
+--------------------------+
Sat Dec 24 00:53:47 UTC 2016
  build_installer: Do not include libtermcap.
  Also, I'd rather see this use the bash package than compile bash, just to
  save a bit of compile time.  There's currently no reason to be compiling
  this, and the given reason is "in case we might need diet configure flags
  sometime in the future".  YAGNI.
+--------------------------+
Tue Jul 12 17:25:10 UTC 2016
  build_installer: Switched soft->hard float CFLAGS.
		   Removed trailing white space.
+--------------------------+
Tue Jun  7 10:36:58 UTC 2016
  build_installer: Added /etc/nfsmount.conf so that any default changes
                   made to the nfs-utils package exist within the installer.
                   Moved some of the file copying script around.
  sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:
     Removed etc/nfsmount.conf, etc/dialogrc (was already copied by the
     build_installer script).
  MoZes.
+--------------------------+
Fri May 27 19:45:28 UTC 2016
  Forgot to make rc.dropbear executable, AAAAAARGH
+--------------------------+
Wed May 25 23:08:19 UTC 2016
  In rc.dropbear, don't tell it to use motd.net, which no longer exists.
+--------------------------+
Fri May 20 17:10:54 UTC 2016
  Include /sbin/e4crypt.
+--------------------------+
Wed May 11 23:43:13 UTC 2016
  In rc.S, comment out making motd.net telling the user to source /etc/profile.
  Dropbear handles things properly without that now.
+--------------------------+
Tue May  3 19:53:33 UTC 2016
  Include md/dm-raid.ko module for LVM with internal RAID support.
+--------------------------+
Sun Apr 24 00:27:03 UTC 2016
  Patched busybox to fix newly created directory perms on 64-bit platforms.
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar 19 21:27:44 UTC 2016
  Increase "full install" size estimate to 9+ GB.
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar 19 19:01:06 UTC 2016
  Add libpci.so.* to the installer, since lspci needs that now.
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar  5 18:12:03 UTC 2016
  Use "mkfs.brtfs -f" in SeTpartitions.  Thanks to Didier Spaier.
+--------------------------+
Wed Mar  2 20:01:32 UTC 2016
  Patch /sbin/probe (again) to hopefully fix NVMe devices on Dell laptops.
+--------------------------+
Sat Feb 20 17:50:37 UTC 2016
  Set empty password for root in /etc/shadow so that root can log in using
  dropbear.  Thanks to MoZes.
+--------------------------+
Wed Feb  3 00:13:29 UTC 2016
  Include all cpufreq modules.
  Keep acpi/processor.ko, needed by acpi-cpufreq.
  Use 'LANG=C fdisk -l' in SeTEFI.
+--------------------------+
Wed Jan 13 19:15:03 UTC 2016
  Fixed this line in /sbin/probe:
    elif [ "$MAJOR" = "259" ]; then
+--------------------------+
#NOT ACTUALLY MERGED SINCE IT DOESN'T WORK
#Tue Jan 12 07:26:02 UTC 2016
#  Use tar to extract the kernel module directory version number from the
#  kernel-modules package.  This is needed for a kernel such as 4.4 which
#  installs modules in /lib/modules/4.4.0/.
+--------------------------+
Thu Dec 24 20:35:26 UTC 2015
  Patched /sbin/probe for nvme partitions.
  Thanks to Didier Spaier.
+--------------------------+
Wed Dec 23 04:09:29 UTC 2015
  Added kernel modules:  block/nvme.ko, mmc/host/sdhci-acpi.ko.
+--------------------------+
Mon Dec 21 08:40:29 UTC 2015
Updates for auto NFS mounting:
sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:
  usr/lib/setup/INSNFS: Use '/etc/rc.d/rc.rpc restart' rather than starting
  rpcbind and rpc.statd directly.
  etc/services: Removed.  Now added by the build_installer.sh script.
build_installer.sh:
  Add /etc/rc.d/rc.rpc to the installer image and chmod +x.
  Add /usr/sbin/sm-notify from nfs-utils package.
  Copy /etc/services from the 'a/etc' package to ensure that it's always up to date.
  Copy /etc/netconfig from the libtirpc package (required for rpc.statd/rpcbind).
  MoZes.
+--------------------------+
Tue Dec 15 21:04:25 UTC 2015
  Remove portmap from package list, add libtirpc and rpcbind.
  Patch INSNFS to run rpcbind instead of rpc.portmap.
+--------------------------+
Tue Dec  1 22:28:10 UTC 2015
  In /etc/motd, don't suggest gdisk and cgdisk for partitioning GPT, since
  fdisk and cfdisk work just fine now.  Also, remove instructions for starting
  PCMCIA and Cardbus devices.  I doubt many people are still using that.
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 25 05:17:36 UTC 2015
  Add /dev/shm and /dev/pts to /etc/fstab.
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 25 02:34:25 UTC 2015
  Change 32-bit x86 $ARCH to i586.
+--------------------------+
Tue Nov 24 21:54:15 UTC 2015
  Added /bin/numfmt to use for converting bytes into K, M, T, or even P.
  Used in the installer itself and in pkgtools.
+--------------------------+
Thu Nov 19 18:02:48 UTC 2015
  Replace udev with eudev/libgudev.
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 18 23:25:57 UTC 2015
  Also support T (although it's not like I wasn't already)
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 18 22:04:08 UTC 2015
  Correct partition sizes, and use K, M, or G.
  Use -F -F for all mkfs.ext* (shut up and do what I say mode)
+--------------------------+
Sat Nov 14 18:54:26 UTC 2015
  Add hwdata package to get pci.ids and usb.ids.
+--------------------------+
Tue Nov  3 19:40:22 UTC 2015
  Added libpcre.so.1, needed by the new grep.
+--------------------------+
Thu Oct 29 19:42:58 GMT 2015
  No longer build dhcpcd version 3, use the dhcpcd package from the 'n'
  series.
  Removed some superfluous white space.  Still more to do ;-)
+--------------------------+
Thu Aug 27 19:55:26 UTC 2015
  Patched build-installer.sh to allow for non-numeric $VERSION in packages.
  Thanks to MoZes.
+--------------------------+
Thu Aug  6 23:42:10 UTC 2015
  sed s/procps/procps-ng/g in build-installer.sh.

Merged updates from MoZes:
build_installer.sh: Enable setting the terminal window title even through

Fetch libfdisk and libsmartcols from /lib, not /usr/lib.
The location was changed since there are binaries outside of /usr
that link to these.

Fix calls to setterm that reset the foreground/background to set the desired

that, too.

Fri Feb 13 20:41:50 UTC 2015
Updates to rc.S in the skeleton_initrd.tar.gz to fix issues with the new
util-linux update.  Also, use -F with mke2fs, otherwise it'll hang if the
partition was previously formatted.
+--------------------------+
Wed Feb 11 01:10:20 UTC 2015
Add libsmartcols fom the new util-linux.
+--------------------------+
Sun Feb  8 14:40:19 GMT 2015
Merged updates from MoZes:
build_installer.sh: Added rtl_nic to the list of firmwares to include.
This firmware is added to the ARM 'a/kernel-firmware' package so will not be present
on x86.
+--------------------------+
Sun Nov 16 19:12:13 UTC 2014
Applied fixes from MoZes:
1) bash patch #12 is UTF8 so it was not caught by the grep, so anything past patch 11
   was never applied.  Fixed to match file types of 'ASCII' and 'text'.
2) ARM does not have syslinux, so we don't want to exit the Installer build because of this.
   Only try and move the syslinux-nomtools binary if we're running on an *86* platform.
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep  9 03:31:31 UTC 2014
Use syslinux-nomtools on the installer.  Thanks to Didier Spaier.
+--------------------------+
Wed Jul 23 22:08:21 UTC 2014
Fix SeTDOS script to show the partition device properly when setting the
security level.  Thanks to luvr on LQ.
+--------------------------+
Fri Apr 18 11:13:15 BST 2014
All of these changes have been tested on ARM and x86.

1. build_installer.sh

  Include both versions of tar from the a/tar-*.t?z package:

  Many users use the installer as a rescue system and tar-1.13 has issues with
  files with long file names:
  http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/%5Bto-devs%5D-slackware-install-iso-tar-version-tooo-old-4175497116/
 
  The pkgtools inside the installer call tar-1.13 directly.  All other
  scripts that call tar (font setting) work properly with tar-1.26.

2. installer/sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz

All of these changes are baked into the new version of the archive.

Summary:-

etc/inittab:  
  Upon shutdown of the installer, kill dropbear to prevent installations
  performed over SSH from hanging until the SSH client times out.

usr/lib/setup/setup:
  Move from x86-centric man-at-keyboard method of finalising the
  installation.  Offer 'reboot' or 'shell' from a dialog prompt - helpful
  for systems that were remotely installed.
  Switch single line of text instruction to remove CD with a dialog box.
+--------------------------+
Sat Feb 15 22:26:01 UTC 2014
Merged updates from MoZes:
build_installer.diff
   Changelog:
  Add 's' and 'x' termcaps so the installation looks pretty when
  installed over serial console using 'screen' as a terminal emulator.
  ARM: Switch the 'versatile' kernel name to 'armv7'.
       Drop an ancient serial console bug fix.

skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:
  Modified etc/profile:
    to allow user to set TERM= as a kernel paramater, so as to set $TERM up front.
    The previous logic was that when console=ttyS was found, the TERM defaulted to vt100
    which was unfortunate because the ARM devices are usually always booted from a serial
    console with that kernel parameter, but are controlled from a fully functional
    Linux terminal emulator.

  Modified etc/rc.S
    Move the keyboard selector to after the profile scripts have been executed, so
    the user can set a useful TERM value that works properly with dialog.

 Modified: usr/lib/setup/SeTnet
    Added 'clear' after dialog finishes, to avoid a messy screen on the serial port
    (for example, after eth0 is initialised with DHCP, drop bear starts and splatters
     its key generation over the blue background, looking badly integrated).
+--------------------------+
Fri Nov  1 01:02:38 UTC 2013
Mute the LVM scan at the end of package installation.
+--------------------------+
Sun Oct 27 21:53:15 UTC 2013
Filter "partitions" found on a USB installer stick in SeTDOS so that
they don't appear in the menu.
+--------------------------+
Sun Oct 13 23:49:24 UTC 2013
Rework /sbin/probe to use gdisk instead of parted, as parted does not
display the partition type code.  This allows detecting swap space
without first running mkswap on it, and prevents unknown partition types
from showing up as Linux partitions.
Added SeTEFI script, which will set up an EFI System Partition.
A partition found on the same device as the root Linux partition will be
preferred, but otherwise any EFI partition found on /dev/sd{a,b,c...}
will be used.
Add /bin/pr, needed by rescan-scsi-bus.sh.
+--------------------------+
Wed Sep 25 05:12:29 UTC 2013
Add support for installing the packages from a USB stick.
This will require changing usbimg2disk to not modify the initrd.
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep 12 07:19:29 UTC 2013
Add freq_table.ko if KMS is requested in the build.
+--------------------------+
Sat Sep  7 21:08:24 UTC 2013
Don't install pt_chown.  It's been removed from glibc-2.18 as a possible
security hole, and is patched out of the glibc-2.17 in -current.
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep  5 22:23:36 UTC 2013
Added os-prober package, since liloconfig is going to use that to find
Windows partitions (avoiding the issue of a USB installer stick being
detected as a Window installation).
+--------------------------+
Fri Aug 16 20:25:48 UTC 2013
Fixed SeTPKG to handle changed output from "dialog --checklist" that no
longer includes quotes.  Also handles the older versions of dialog.
+--------------------------+
Mon Aug 12 20:50:58 UTC 2013
Use /etc/dialogrc from the dialog package, since the syntax has changed.
+--------------------------+

Reset background color after a CD switch during installation.
+--------------------------+
Fri Apr 19 05:43:00 UTC 2013

This will avoid parsing issues if we ever i18n this thing...
+--------------------------+
Wed Mar 27 03:37:00 UTC 2013
By default, add nomodeset to the kernel command line.
If modesetting is needed, boot with kms.s or kmssmp.s.
+--------------------------+
Tue Mar 19 05:30:44 UTC 2013
Added missing ehci-hcd module.
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar 16 05:45:29 UTC 2013
Modified usbboot.img to work with EFI as well.
Don't build efiboot.img.
+--------------------------+
Tue Mar 12 04:35:07 UTC 2013
Keep GPU modules, needed for video on UEFI. (ADD_KMS=1)
Support building an EFI boot image.  (EFIBOOT=1)
Keep USB host modules, as huge.s is no longer building those in.
Added two Terminus fonts to the initrd.
Added setfont to busybox (needed to load an appropriate sized Terminus
font when KMS is used).
Patched busybox to fix a compile issue with glibc-2.17.
+--------------------------+
Wed Feb 20 18:53:11 UTC 2013
Support not adding network card firmware. (Stuart Winter)
+--------------------------+

+--------------------------+
Thu Aug  9 02:36:37 UTC 2012
Added support for MMC devices to /sbin/probe (needed for Raspberry Pi).
Thanks to David Spencer.
+--------------------------+
Sat Aug  4 21:05:51 UTC 2012
Switch from gdisk to gptdisk, and add new cgdisk and fixparts tools.
Copy /etc/modprobe.d/ and /lib/modprobe.d/ to the installer.
+--------------------------+
Thu Jul 26 21:52:59 UTC 2012
Use '-s' option with eject, otherwise it fails.
Fixed a missing space that broke a SeTnet dialog:
-   "\nAttempting to fetch a remote configuration file using $PROTO ..."54 56
+   "\nAttempting to fetch a remote configuration file using $PROTO ..." 54 56
+--------------------------+

Point /bin/sh -> /bin/bash
Don't build a shell into busybox.
+--------------------------+
Wed Mar 28 01:30:00 UTC 2012
fixed placement of /lib{,64}/libz.so.*, danke MoZes
+--------------------------+
Mon Mar 26 00:53:08 UTC 2012
In SeTpartitions, use -d single -m single as it increases performance by
about 15%, and Luigi Genoni says multiple metadata copies are useless when
using a btrfs filesystem consisting of a single device or partition (which
is all the installer currently supports).
+--------------------------+
Sat Apr 23 18:17:21 UTC 2011
sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:  Try to load loop device module.
build_installer.sh:  Try to load loop device module.

build_installer.sh:  ADD_MANPAGES to arm.
+--------------------------+
Fri Apr 15 18:25:28 UTC 2011

  with PXE server changes.
+--------------------------+
Tue Apr 12 19:21:47 UTC 2011

sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:  Add terse installation mode that only
  displays one line per package so that people's heads do not explode
+--------------------------+
Fri Mar 18 04:44:04 UTC 2011
sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:  Increase estimate of full install
  size to "6.5+ GB"
+--------------------------+
Tue Mar  8 05:13:38 UTC 2011
build_installer.sh:  Add a kludgy but working man page whitelist and get
  man pages on the x86 and x86_64 installers for partitioning tools,
  filesystem tools, network stuff, and a few other things.
  Added partx, findmnt, lsblk, fsfreeze, fstrim, and swaplabel.
  Don't wipe /usr/man.
  Use bzip2 for man pages (wins compression tests on man page text here easily)
  ln -sf /etc/motd /root/README
sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:  Add /usr/man directory.
  rc.S:  chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia

+--------------------------+
Fri Feb 25 05:44:11 UTC 2011
build_installer.sh:  Support ADD_MANPAGES option
  to add preprocessed manpages.
  Not enabled for now.
  This would really need a blacklist and/or whitelist first.
sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:  Replace broken zcat symlink
  with the proper script.
  Point /usr/bin/zcat at the zcat script.
  Add a quick+dirty /usr/bin/man shell script to display man pages.

sources/busybox/busybox-dot-config:  Upgraded.
+--------------------------+
Fri Feb 18 03:22:17 UTC 2011
sources/initrd/skeleton_initrd.tar.gz:  fdisk -l now shows HPFS/NTFS/exFAT, so
  we need to check for NTFS before FAT in SeTDOS to avoid a false FAT detection.
+--------------------------+
Wed Feb 16 07:45:13 UTC 2011
build_installer.sh:  util-linux-ng -> util-linux
+--------------------------+
Tue Feb 15 23:04:25 UTC 2011
