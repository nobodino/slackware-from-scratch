PKGNAM=dialog

# Think twice (or more) before upgrading this - the latest versions completely
# destroy the careful formatting in the Slackware installer. While it's lost
# to history now for the most part, I was the original beta tester for dialog,
# which was created to support our installer. I even wrote the --infobox widget
# before the first release. While I appreciate the advances dialog has made in
# the years since then, I'm not about to quickly shoot myself in the foot again
# (think tar-1.13 ;-). If you are reading this and think that Slackware "needs"
# to have the latest dialog, I'm willing to listen to your rationale. However,
# unless it's been tested with the installer and every other script in Slackware
# that uses dialog and found to work, and you've already gotten any needed
# patches accepted upstream... well... I like this version. If it's got bugs,
# they aren't bugs that I'm running into often.
#
# Update: dialog-1.3-20191210 actually passes the formatting tests here (with a
# couple of patches), so we will take our first dialog upgrade in quite a while.
#VERSION=1.3-20191210
