# If you'd like to start something different or in a different order than
# the options below, create your own startup script /etc/rc.d/rc.4.local

# Try to use GNOME's gdm session manager.  This comes first because if
# gdm is on the machine then the user probably installed it and wants
# to use it by default:
if [ -x /usr/bin/gdm ]; then
  exec /usr/bin/gdm -nodaemon
fi

# Someone thought that gdm looked prettier in /usr/sbin,
# so look there, too:
if [ -x /usr/sbin/gdm ]; then
  exec /usr/sbin/gdm -nodaemon
fi

# Not there?  OK, try to use KDE's kdm session manager:
if [ -x /opt/kde/bin/kdm ]; then
  exec /opt/kde/bin/kdm -nodaemon
elif [ -x /usr/bin/kdm ]; then
  exec /usr/bin/kdm -nodaemon
fi

# Look for SDDM as well:
if [ -x /usr/bin/sddm ]; then
  exec /usr/bin/sddm
fi

# If all you have is XDM, I guess it will have to do:
if [ -x /usr/bin/xdm ]; then
  exec /usr/bin/xdm -nodaemon
elif [ -x /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm ]; then
  exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon
