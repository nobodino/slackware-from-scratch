# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

sudo: 'sudo' is a command that allows users to execute some commands as 
sudo: root. The /etc/sudoers file (edited with 'visudo') specifies which
sudo: users have access to sudo and which commands they can run. 'sudo' 
sudo: logs all its activities to /var/log/ so the system administrator
