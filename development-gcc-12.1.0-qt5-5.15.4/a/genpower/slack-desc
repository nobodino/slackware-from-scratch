# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

genpower: The genpower daemon, genpowerd, will monitor the status of a serial

genpower: needed steps to react to the condition of the UPS. This may include
genpower: shutting the system down, or canceling a pending shutdown if the
genpower: power is restored.
